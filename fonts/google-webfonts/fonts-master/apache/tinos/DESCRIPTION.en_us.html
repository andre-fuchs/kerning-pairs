<p>Tinos was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing serif
design that is metrically compatible with Times New Romanâ„¢. Tinos offers
improved on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL
character set and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible
fonts to address document portability across platforms.</p>
