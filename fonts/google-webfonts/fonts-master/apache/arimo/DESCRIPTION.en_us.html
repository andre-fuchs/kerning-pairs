<p>Arimo was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans
serif design that is metrically compatible with Arialâ„¢. Arimo offers improved
on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set
and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to
address document portability across platforms.</p>
