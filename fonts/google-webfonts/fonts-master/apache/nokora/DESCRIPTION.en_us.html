<p>This font was designed especially for the user interfaces of mobile
platforms. The metrics are compatible with the Latin glyphs of Droid Sans and
the number of glyphs is less than in other Khmer fonts, so the file size of
font is smaller and loads faster on the web. The font has been prepared
specially for use on the web.</p>

<p>This version of Nokora has the OpenType tables required for Khmer rendering
with the Harfbuzz found in Android 3.1+ and Android 4.0. The OpenType tables
in this font also work with Uniscribe system in Microsoft Windows the CoreText
system found in Apple Mac OS X Lion.</p>

<p>Nokora started as the Droid Sans files which were modified by Dahn
Hong.</p>

<p>It was updated in September 2012.</p>
