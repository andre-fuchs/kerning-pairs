Basic Font Information

Buenard is a high-quality serif typeface for art books.
Itâ€™s based on the Transitional Roman classical structure, 
with less contrasted strokes and heavier serifs.
It has its own contemporary style, combining elegance, 
consistency and legibility for all text sizes, making 
it an excellent choice when selecting a serif font.
Buenard was designed for an Argentinian art publisher 
and its being developed as the final project in the 
Postgraduate Career in Typography at the University 
of Buenos Aires.

Designed by Gustavo Ibarra for FontFuror (www.fontfuror.com).

Buenard is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement.
