<p>Milonga is a Font inspired on “tangueros” art. This is a tribute to the
“rioplatense” culture, so colored, full of love and hate, family, friends and
enemies stories told in countless Tangos and Milongas (folk music genre from
Argentina). This graceful, flowing and rhythmic font is formed by graphic
elements found in a kind of classic painting from this area called “fileteado
porteño”; with terminations involving petals, round and pointy details.</p>

<p>Milonga is useful for headlines, where the characteristics of the font are
highlighted.</p>
