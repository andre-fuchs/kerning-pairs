FONTLOG for the Hanalei font

This file provides detailed information on the Hanalei font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Hanalei
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Hanalei is for the Polynesian fan. Inspired by the bamboo lettering
of the iconic Mai Kai restaurant logo, Hanalei has all the flavor
of the genre without compromise. Great for titling and larger
typesetting.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Hanalei is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
