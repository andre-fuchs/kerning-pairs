Basic Font Information

Ruluko is a typeface designed to aid those learning to read. 
The shapes you see are related to the handwriting typically 
used at schools in Argentina. The concept is that those who 
have learned to read this handwriting style may recognise 
this type style more easily than other typefaces often used 
in this context. But as a warm and stylish sans serif text 
type, you may use Ruluko for any purpose.

Designed by Ana Sanfelippo (@anasanfelippo), Angélica Díaz

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
