3. ChangeLog

   31 Aug 2011 (Dave Crossland) Sorts Mill Goudy version 3.101
   prepared for use as a web font: vertical metrics changed to
   avoid clipping on Windows and be the same across styles; 
   hinting removed and replaced with 'magic' GASP and PREP
   tables; license metadata simplified, and glyph outlines 
   run through FontForge's 'Add Extrema' and 'Simplify' 
   features to reduce filesize.

   2 Jul 2010 (Barry Schwartz) OFL Sorts Mill Goudy version 3.1.

   9 Jan 2010 (Barry Schwartz) OFL Sorts Mill Goudy version 3.0.
