<p>Cantora ('Singer' in Spanish) is a friendly semi formal, semi condensed,semi sans serif. It has reminiscences of hand lettering, mixing straight andbowed stems, and natural curves.</p><p>It was born as an experiment in drawing from the outside to the inside(drawing the space surrounding the letters first, instead of drawing theletters themselves) in trying to apply the ideas and methods of Michael Harveyand Evert Bloemsma to my own glyphs construction.</p><p>Although Cantora is a sans, the lowercase letters have serif proportions.It's perfect for headlines (H1, H2, H3) in sizes larger than 20px.</p>
