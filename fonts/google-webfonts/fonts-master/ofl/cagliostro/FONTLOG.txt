FONTLOG for the Cagliostro fontsThis file provides detailed information on the Cagliostro Font Software.This information should be distributed along with the Cagliostro fontsand any derivative works.Basic Font Information
Cagliostro was inspired by the early 20th Century lettering work of Ozwald Bruce Cooper. Care was taken to preserve the original hand-lettered feel of his work while updating the style for modern use. The x-height was increased from the original style and some of the more quirky aspects were toned back. The end result is a very handsome and unique sans that is very useful for titles and short blocks of text.Documentation can be found at http://www.madtype.comTo contribute to the project contact Matthew Desmond at mattdesmond@gmail.comChangeLog01 Dec 2011 (Matthew Desmond) Cagliostro v1.001- Initial releaseAcknowledgementsIf you make modifications be sure to add your name (N), email (E), web-address(if you have one) (W) and description (D).
