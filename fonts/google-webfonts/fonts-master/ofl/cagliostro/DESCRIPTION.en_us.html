<p>Cagliostro was inspired by the early 20th Century lettering work of Ozwald Bruce Cooper. Care was taken to preserve the original hand-lettered feel of his work while updating the style for modern use. The x-height was increased from the original style and some of the more quirky aspects were toned back. The end result is a very handsome and unique sans that is very useful for titles and short blocks of text.</p> <p>Documentation can be found at <a href="http://www.madtype.com">www.madtype.com</a> and to contribute to the project contact Matthew Desmond at <a href="mailto:mattdesmond@gmail.com">mattdesmond@gmail.com</a></p>
