FONTLOG for the Quintessential font

This file provides detailed information on the Quintessential Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Quintessential font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Quintessential typeface is a calligraphic lettering style based
on the Italic Hand. As speed became more essential in writing hands,
styles became less formal and more relaxed. Classic, clean, and casual,
Quintessential fits a lot of design uses - hence its name.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Quintessential is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. Quintessential-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. Quintessential-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. Quintessential-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
