FONTLOG for the Cinzel Decorative font

This file provides detailed information on Cinzel Decorative Font Software. 

This information should be distributed along with the Cinzel Decorative font 
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Cinzel Decorative is a typeface inspired in first century roman inscriptions, and based
on classical proportions. However it’s not a simple revival. While it conveys
all the ancient history of the Latin alphabet, it is also infused with a
contemporary feel. This is a small caps sister family to the regular family.

Cinzel Decorative is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use 
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

All the source files are in UFO format. The font was designed in Glyphs, and
UFO is an interchangeable source format supported natively by Fontforge and
with a plug-in for FontLab.

There are three files for each style in the family:

1. Family-Style.ufo - Masters as originally drawn with contour overlaps 
   and composed components

2. Family-Style-OTF.ufo Each individual weight, with decomposed 
   components and overlaps removed, corresponding to the OTF file

3. Family-Style.otf - The final OTF file
