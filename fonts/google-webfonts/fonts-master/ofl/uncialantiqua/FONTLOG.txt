FONTLOG for the Uncial Antiqua font

This file provides detailed information on the Uncial Antiqua font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Uncial Antiqua
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Uncial Antiqua is a hybrid typeface which combines the speedier penned
styles of Uncial and Half Uncial letterforms together in a formal text
representation. Signature letterforms to the Uncial & Half Uncial styles
are not sacrificed in this compilation, yet readability is surprisingly
maintained when read in context.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Uncial Antiqua is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
