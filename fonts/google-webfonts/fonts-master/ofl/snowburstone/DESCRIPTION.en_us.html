<p>Snowburst One is a low contrast serifed display typeface inspired by one of
Annet Stirling's distinctive styles of lettering. Snowburst One's personality
consistently shows in both small and large sizes. Because of the thin stokes
this font is best used from medium to large sizes. Despite its surprising
forms Snowburst is highly legible. Readers are likely to be both surprised and
entertained by its unusual but friendly forms.</p>
