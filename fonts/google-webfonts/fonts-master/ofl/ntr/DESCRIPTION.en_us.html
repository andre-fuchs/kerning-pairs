NTR is a Telugu handwriting font inspired by the artist Bapu who is famous among Telugu people. 
Many artists followed him and created their own style and this font shows that influence. 
It is suitable for headings, posters, invitations and anywhere you want to use a handwriting font. 
NTR is named after Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, who worked tirelessly for the self-respect and well being of Telugu people around the world.
