<p>Donegal One is a text typeface designed to be highly legible and comfortable
when reading on screen. Donegal's utility and personality consistently shows
from small text sizes to display. Donegal uses the cut interior curve
associated with W.A. Dwiggins. This feature is one of many that contribute to
Donegal's distinctive and pleasing character.</p>
