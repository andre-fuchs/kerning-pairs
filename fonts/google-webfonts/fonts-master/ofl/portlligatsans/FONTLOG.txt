FONTLOG for the Port Lligat fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Port Lligat Sans
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Port Lligat Sans fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Port Lligat Sans is a display typeface. 
It has a soft variation in strokes, condensed 
structure, vertical stress, and a well balance 
groovy rhythm. It is particularly useful for 
both short text and headlines, but it is also 
comfortable for reading on screen. It is designed 
to become a super family with styles in many 
different typographical categories matching the 
exactly weight and width across the whole family. 
As a result they can be used together in many 
different ways.  The first releases are the 
regular Roman styles of the Sans and Slab 
families. The Sans is the basic structure 
for the rest of the styles. It has a white 
interior simple form, non showy terminals. 
The strokes are not straight, they have 
entasis on them, also in the end of the 
strokes as terminals.
