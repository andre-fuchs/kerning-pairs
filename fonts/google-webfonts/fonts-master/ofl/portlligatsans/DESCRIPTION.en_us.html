<p>Port Lligat Sans is a display typeface. It has a soft variation in strokes, condensed structure, vertical stress, and a well balance groovy rhythm. It is particularly useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen. It is designed to become a super family with styles in many different typographical categories matching the exactly weight and width across the whole family. As a result they can be used together in many different ways.  The first releases are the regular Roman styles of the Sans and Slab families. The Sans is the basic structure for the rest of the styles. It has a white interior simple form, non showy terminals. The strokes are not straight, they have entasis on them, also in the end of the strokes as terminals.</p>
