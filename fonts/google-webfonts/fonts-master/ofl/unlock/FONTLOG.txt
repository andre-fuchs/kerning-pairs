FONTLOG for the Unlock fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Unlock Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Unlock fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Unlock is a geometric typeface with vertical stress, short 
descenders and a significant "x" height . Basic shapes from 
rectangles, some with rounded corners (the only presence 
of curves), completely rectangular counterpounchs and 
innovative solutions for the joints, make Unlock has 
a unique style.

Their rough appearance, reminiscent of the old types 
of wood although the design of many of the signs we 
associate also a futuristic design.

Unlock is ideal for the composition of headlines and 
short texts but its design provides for the possibility 
of using it in small sizes.
