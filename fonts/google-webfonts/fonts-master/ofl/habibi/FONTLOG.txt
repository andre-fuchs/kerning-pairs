FONTLOG for the Habibi font

This file provides detailed information on the Habibi font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Habibi font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Habibi is a high contrast serifed text face. Habibi is easy to 
read and offers a certain elegance to go with this. Habibi draws 
both on the qualities of 15th and 16th century text faces and 
on crisp contenporary ones. Habibi can be used from small 
sizes to larger display settings.

Habibi is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
