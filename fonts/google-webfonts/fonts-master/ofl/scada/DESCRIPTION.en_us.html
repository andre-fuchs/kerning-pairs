<p>In 2005, Scada was designed as the corporate identity font for the Latvian
design studio <a href="http://www.scada.lv">Scada.lv</a>. In 2011 the design
studio decided to make Scada a libre font. Over 6 months the font was
reworked, improved and expanded into a family. It has a modern style,
specifically designed for small sizes.</p>
