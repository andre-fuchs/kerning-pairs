<p>Dawning of a New Day is based on the handwriting of a friend.  The title was chosen by my friend, but also had great meaning to me. I like to think of each new day as a chance to start fresh, free from past mistakes. It is my desire that the light, fluid motions of this script mimic that hopeful feeling.</p>
