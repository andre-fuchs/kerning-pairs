Basic Font Information

I enjoyed designing this typeface because it was inspired by my little son
"Jonah," who is called by his friends "Joti." The type has the informality and
style of the cartoons which children watch. Its primary concept is top-heavy
stems with a slight sense of movement to further enhance the style. Joti is
ideal for composing headlines and short texts in sizes larger than 14
points.

Joti One is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

Joti One has an Extended Latin character set so it is useful for most
languages that use the Latin alphabet, Including: Albanian, Croatian, Czech,
Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish,French, German,
Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese,Norwegian,
Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and
Welsh.
