FONTLOG for the Oldenburg font

This file provides detailed information on Oldenburg Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Oldenburg 
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Oldenburg is inspired by nearly monoline handwritting seen on 
a series of German posters. It has been changed and adaped to 
be more broadly useful design than a more faithful interpretation 
would have been. Despite the increased ulity in Oldernburg it 
still presenst plenty of the whimsical feeling that made its 
source so attractive. Oldenburg can be used a in a wide 
range of sizes.

Oldenburg is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
