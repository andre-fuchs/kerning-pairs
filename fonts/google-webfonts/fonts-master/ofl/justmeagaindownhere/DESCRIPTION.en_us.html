<p>Just Me Again Down Here was created a few weeks after my family and I moved to China, using a Wacom Tablet and Adobe Illustrator.</p> <p>This is my “messy” handwriting with mixed capitals and irregularities.   After moving to China and finding myself without the ability to communicate in my new home country’s language, creating a font was something that reminded me that I did know how to do <em>something</em> and I would survive those first confusing weeks abroad.</p>
