FONTLOG for the Finger Paint font

This file provides detailed information on the Finger Paint
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Finger Paint fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Finger Paint was designed by Ralph du Carrois.

Build a complete font in one hour. In the beginning Finger Paint was just an
experiment with Illustrator artistic brushes but then actually became a real
typeface.

Its name stands for itself. And, yes, it took a liiiiitle bit more than one
hour to make it a working typeface.

Finger Paint is a Unicode typeface that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1

For each style there are three .VFB Source files:
1. Family-Style.vfb (Original Source file with contour overlaps)
2. Family-Style-OTF.vfb (Merged contours and optimized file 
                         corresponding to the OTF file)
3. Family-Style-TTF.vfb (TrueType outlines with hinting 
                         adjustments corresponding to the TTF file)
