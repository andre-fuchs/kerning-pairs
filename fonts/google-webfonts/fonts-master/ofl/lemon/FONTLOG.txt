FONTLOG for the Lemon fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Lemon Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Unlock fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Lemon One is a display typeface with soft and fluid shapes 
that come from painted street shop signage. The dark weight 
is ideal for headlines and short texts, and a future release 
of a lighter weight could be useful for longer text. 
The uppercase letters are very carefully drawn, making an 
attractive and unique design for text in all caps, compound 
words in capital letters, and acronyms. The same dynamic 
is inherent in the lowercase and numbers!
