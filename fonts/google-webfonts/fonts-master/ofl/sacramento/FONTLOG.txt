FONTLOG for the Sacramento font

This file provides detailed information on the Sacramento Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Sacramento font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Sacramento typeface is a monoline, semi-connected script inspired by
hand-lettering artist brochure work of the 1950's and 1960's. It stands on a
thin line between formal and casual lettering styles, yet it has a commanding
presence for headlines and titles.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Sacramento is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. Sacramento-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. Sacramento-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. Sacramento-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
