<p>Risque finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1962 Looney
Toons cartoon called "Martian through Georgia". Originally an all 
Capitals reference, it has been created with a lowercase as lively as
the irregular latin-esque Capitals. A frolicking fun typeface for
retro and all-around offbeat occasions.</p>
