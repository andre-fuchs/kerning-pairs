FONTLOG for the Risque font

This file provides detailed information on the Risque font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Risque
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Risque finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1962 Looney
Toons cartoon called "Martian through Georgia". Originally an all 
Capitals reference, it has been created with a lowercase as lively as
the irregular latin-esque Capitals. A frolicking fun typeface for
retro and all-around offbeat occasions.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Risque is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
