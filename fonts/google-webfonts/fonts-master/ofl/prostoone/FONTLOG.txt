Basic Font Information

for logos and presentations. The project's initiator and
chief designer is— Pavel Emelyanov, who worked with his 
mentor Ivan Gladkikh, known as Jovanny Lemonad, who helped
with technical expertize to finalize the font.

that use the Cyrillic, Baltic, Turkish, Central Europe, 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Central European, 
Turkish, Baltic, Cyrillic.
