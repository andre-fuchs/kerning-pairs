FONTLOG for the Sirin font

This file provides detailed information on the Sirin 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Sirin fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Sirin Stencil is a display humanist sans typeface
by Olga Karpushina with careful brush-inspired detailing.
It is designed for large sizes, but works surprizingly
well in small body copy, when its stencil gaps merge.
Sirin will work well on colored backgrounds
creating an optical 3D effect.

Sirin is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1

2. SirinStencil-Regular-TTF.vfb (Mastered TTF with manual hinting applied)
