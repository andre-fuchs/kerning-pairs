FONTLOG for the Emblema font

This file provides detailed information on the Emblema font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Emblema font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Emblema One is inspired by UK Victorian era bold italic display 
type. It breaks from tradition by using a stenciled kind of 
construction. The stencil style too is atypical and gives the font 
its distinctive feeling. Emblema One has been made for display 
purposes and should be used from medium to large sizes.

Emblema is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: 
Latin-1, Latin-2: Easern Europe, Turkish, Macintosh Character Set
