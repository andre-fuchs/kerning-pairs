This information should be distributed along with the Eagle Lake font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Eagle Lake typeface is a calligraphic lettering style based on the 
practical Running Book Hand. It has shorter capitals that create a visually
taller x-height lending to high legibility and fluidity.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Eagle Lake is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. EagleLake-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. EagleLake-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. EagleLake-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
