Basic Font Information

Revalia is a display sans-serif typeface design, loosely based 
on the packaging labels of 20th century canned goods. The design 
has a high x-height, wide letter shapes and the design flirts 
with medieval letterforms.

Revalia is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to 
support other scripts. 

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
