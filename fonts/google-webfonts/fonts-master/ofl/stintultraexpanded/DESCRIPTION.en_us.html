<p>Stint Ultra Expanded is an ultra expanded square serif typestyle developed based on the letterforms of the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Syncopate">Syncopate Family</a>. Syncopate boasts extra wide unicase forms, and Stint Ultra Expanded follows this direction, featuring wide letterforms of both the capital and lowercase varieties. This is the opposite of the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Stint+Ultra+Condensed">Stint Ultra Condensed</a> typestyle.</p> <p>Highly legible and matching the Syncopate family width, Stint Ultra Expanded is a perfect font for powerful headlines and copy when realty on websites and designs is less of a concern.</p> <p>To contribute to the project contact Brian J.
