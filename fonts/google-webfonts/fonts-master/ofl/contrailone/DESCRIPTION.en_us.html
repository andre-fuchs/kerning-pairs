<p>Contrail is based on handmade sans letters seen on UK posters. It's slight slant and bouncy quality suggest the emerging jet age and a state of both readiness and excited anticipation. Its rounded corners give it an approachable friendly feeling. Contrail is a low contrast design that  is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font was made specifically to be used as web type.</p>
