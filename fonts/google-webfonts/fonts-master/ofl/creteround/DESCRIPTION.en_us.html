<p>Crete Round is a warm slab serif providing a hint of softness to texts. It started as a tailored version of the <a href="http://www.type-together.com/Crete">original Crete fonts</a>, created specially to serve as corporate typeface for the type design competition <a href="http://www.letter2.org/">Letter2</a>. Crete Round is more independent from the original with modified terminals and serifs to create two new fonts that deliver a more contemporary and functional appearance. The tall x-height, low contrast and sturdy slabs prove to be surprisingly efficient for web use.</p>
