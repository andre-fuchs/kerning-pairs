<p>This is revival of the 1913 typeface "Glass Antiqua" by "Genzsch &amp; Heyse" found in the Taschen book "Type: A Visual History of Typefaces and Graphic Styles, 1901-1938." A magnificent and unique design with a Jugenstile fleur, combining Slab Serif and Antiqua, plus elements of cursive calligraphy. It is suitable for any purpose, giving a text a retro feel and soft informal look. The character set is extended but the originals are carefully restored, and all are patiently spaced and kerned.</p>
