<p>Numans font is a modern 'grotesque' sans-serif with open forms. Sometimes I would like to call it "Humans," but since I am from Russia, my English is not so fluent and sometimes I can be confused. The name comes from romanticising this. Numans is similar to the more bold font Days One, also available in Google Web Fonts.</p>
