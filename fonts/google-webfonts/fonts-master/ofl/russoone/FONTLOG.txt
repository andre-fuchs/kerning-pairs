FONTLOG for Russo One

This file provides detailed information on the Russo One Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Russo One and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Russo means Russian. It seems strange that in a such font 
there is no snow, vodka or bears. What I wanted to show is 
that Russian culture is quite varied and modern. In Russia, 
too, some people love good fonts and typography. Russo is 
designed for headlines and logotypes. It is simple and 
original, stylish and casual.

Russo One is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Cyrillic, Baltic, Turkish, Central 
Europe, Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, Baltic, 
Cyrillic, Central Europe

There is one source file, 

1. RussoOne-Regular-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
