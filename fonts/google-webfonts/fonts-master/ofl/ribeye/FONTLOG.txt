FONTLOG for the Ribeye and Ribeye Marrow fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Ribeye font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Ribeye fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Ribeye & Ribeye Marrow are reminiscent of a cartoon tattoo style of
lettering, but exhibit a playfulness that breaks traditional weight
distribution across its letterforms.

An edgy attitude, friendly syncopation, and highly legible
letterforms makes these fonts a real pair of charmers.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Ribeye and Ribeye Marrow are a Unicode typeface family that
supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
