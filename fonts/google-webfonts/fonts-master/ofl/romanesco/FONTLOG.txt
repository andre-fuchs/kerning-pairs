FONTLOG for the Romanesco font

This file provides detailed information on the Romanesco Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Romanesco font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Romanesco typeface is a refined, semi-bold and narrow hand crafted calligraphic style. 

With stabbing strokes that nod to historical styles, and modern flair leaning towards the current, Romanesco lends itself to a wide array of stylistic uses for a narrow typestyle.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Romanesco is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. Romanesco-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. Romanesco-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. Romanesco-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
