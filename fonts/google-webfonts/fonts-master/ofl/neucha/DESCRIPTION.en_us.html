<p>You will throw tomatoes at me when I say that the font Neucha was invented for the sake of one and only one phrase: “I love you”. It was 2005 and I was in love. The first version of the font was done in 8 hours. I recently redid this fastfont from scratch, some glyphs have changed greatly but most of them I did not touch – just polished. Neucha very strong in terms of energy and I love it. Neucha translated from the Russian language means “not knowing how to create fonts right”.</p>
