FONTLOG for the Montaga font.

This file provides detailed information on the Montaga 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Montaga fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Montage is an Old Style font, inspired by Venetian 
calligraphy. Her main feature is the strong inclination 
in the modulation axis, that generates shapes with marked 
stress. This gives her a strong personality. The
uppercases are slender and arrogant, and the narrowness 
of shapes provide optimum performance.

Montaga is evolving and will be updated.
As of now there is only Regular style. 

Montaga is a work in progress and will be improved 
regularly. This means you can request improvements and 
even fund specific features if they are outside of 
the current scope of work.
