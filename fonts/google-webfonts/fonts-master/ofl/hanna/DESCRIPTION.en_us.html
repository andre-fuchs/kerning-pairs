<p>Woowa Brothers, a company dedicated to contributing to the world’s graceful progress by utilizing information technology, has created the ‘Hanna’ font for everyone to use. Hanna reflects Woowa Brothers’ kitsch and retro identity; it is reminiscent of our childhood memories of trying to draw something really nice, yet our drawing turns out to be a little rough and half-baked. Hanna is just like that kid’s drawing, and will bring you back to the time when you were little. Enjoy and share!</p>
