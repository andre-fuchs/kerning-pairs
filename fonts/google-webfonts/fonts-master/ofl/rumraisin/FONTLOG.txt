FONTLOG for the Rum Raisin font

This file provides detailed information on the Rum Raisin font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Rum Raisin font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Rum Raisin draws inspiration from a vintage Kelloggs Raisin Bran cereal
box. Taken from a formerly unicase design, this has been developed as
a caps/lowercase character set. The original unicase a is in the Delta
character slot, as an alternate to a more suitable A.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Rum Raisin is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
