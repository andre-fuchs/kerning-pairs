Basic Font Information

Inspired by Easter Island and its Rapa Nui language and culture, 
this typeface captures the essence of an island located in Chile, 
South America, full of mystery, sacred places and stories of the 
past. “Inika” means “ink” in the Rapa Nui language, and it 
represents the tradition of the rongo-rongo writing, used by 
people on the island thousands of years ago. The tiki style 
was worked into the characters with a light touch while 
developing the upper and lowercase letters forms to evoke 
the spirit of the island. Inika is useful for both long 
text setting, document titles, and even large display sizes.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
