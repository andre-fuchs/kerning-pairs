FONTLOG for the Fascinate Inline fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Fascinate 
Inline font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Fascinate
Inline fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Fascinate & Fascinate Inline are nods to Art Deco yesteryear and
typefaces like Broadway, yet they have an exaggerated x-height and
softness that give it a friendly yet sophisticated vibe. 

Even with their high contrast weighting, the Fascinate family is 
cleanly legible at small sizes, although the Inline version is 
better visible at larger display sizes.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Fascinate and Fascinate Inline are a Unicode typeface family that
supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
