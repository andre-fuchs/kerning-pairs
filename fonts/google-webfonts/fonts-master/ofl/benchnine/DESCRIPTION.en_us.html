<p>The design of BenchNine is loosely based on the look of the ink spreads and
bleeds characteristic of traditional or vernacular woodcut type. The design
takes a mash-up of a number of old Stephenson Blake designs and rounds the
corners a little. In theory the face should work well for headlines that want
to stand out just a little from the crowd.</p>
