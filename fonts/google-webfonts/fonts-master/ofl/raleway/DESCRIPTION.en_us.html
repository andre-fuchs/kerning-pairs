Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. 
Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini.
A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.

It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

It also has a sister family, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway+Dots">Raleway Dots</a>.
