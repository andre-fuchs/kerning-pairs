<p>Jacques Francois revives the c. 1760 Enschedé no. 811 type specimen by Jacques
François Rosart (1714-1774), made for Enschedé Printing House. The concept was
to create a contemporary webfont with an even typographic color while
preserving the essential historic peculiarities and expanding the character
set. Compared to the historic specimen the x-height is generously increased
and contrast lowered.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois is designed for medium to small sizes. For this purpose its
features were altered: contrast was lowered and x-height significantly
increased. Designed by Manvel Shmavonyan, Alexei Vanyashin. Jacques Francois
includes old style figures.</p>

<p>There is also <a

Francois Shadow</a>, an incised variant of the Jacques Francois font.</p>
