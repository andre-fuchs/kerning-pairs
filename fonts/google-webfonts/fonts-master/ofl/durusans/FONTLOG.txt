Duru Sans Font Information

Duru Sans is a classic low contrast 20th century style sans design. 
Duru is a new take on mixing the humanist urge with the modernist one. 
Duru also somehow manages to be elegant and a workhorse type at the 
same time. Duru can be used at a wide range of sizes.

Duru Sans is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, 
and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2: Easern Europe, Turkish, 
Macintosh Character Set.

There are two Source files:

1. Duru Sans-Regular.vfb

2. Duru Sans-Regular-otf.sfd
Merged contours and optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

3. Duru Sans-Regular-ttf.sfd

TTF file
