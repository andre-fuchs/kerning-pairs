<p>Ropa Sans is an open-source subset of the Ropa Sans Pro family. Ropa Sans Pro consists of 8 weights plus extra designed italics and small caps, with extensive coverage of Latin and essential coverage of Cyrillic and Greek scripts, and is available commercially from <a href="http://lettersoup.de/">lettersoup.de</a>.</p>

<p>This Open Font License version, Ropa Sans, consists of the regular weight and the corresponding italic, and covers Latin-based languages only.</p>

<p>While the upright styles pay a distant homage to the technical aesthetics of the early-20th century DIN series, the strongly humanistic italics breathe in quirky freshness and create a unique flavour. The step to a remarkable Italic with its extreme ink-traps caused a hard change of nearly all shapes of the first slices of Roman.</p>
