Basic Font Information

Fondamento & Fondamento Italic are calligraphic lettering styles based
on the traditional Foundational Hand, a basic teaching style created 
by Edward Johnston in the early 20th century. The letterforms are clear
and cleanly legible, basic and formal.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Fondamento and Fondamento Italic are a Unicode typeface family that
supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
