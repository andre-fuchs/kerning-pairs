FONTLOG for the Grand Hotel font

This file provides detailed information on the Grand Hotel font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Grand Hotel
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Grand Hotel finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1937
film "Cafe Metropole" starring Tyrone Power. This condensed upright
connecting script has a classic vibe to it. 

It has a wonderful weight to it that feels subtly tied to Holiday
and Bakery themed designs, even though it can work outside that genre.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky and Jim Lyles for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Grand Hotel is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
