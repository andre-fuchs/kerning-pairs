FONTLOG for the Racing Sans font

Basic Font Information

Around 1860 (100 years before Helvetica and Univers) the very first Sans Serif typefaces to include lowercase letters used to have very high contrast (the difference between thick and thin lines), as they were created based on serif typefaces of the time.

As the genre evolved, the fashion was to create 'monoline' sans, of very little contrast.
Today, high contrast sans are very rare, and only a few are successful.

While digging in old specimens, we found three that immediately caught our attention:
Doric Italic and Taylor Gothic from American Type Founders (1897), and Charter Oak from Keystone Type Foundry of Philadelphia (1906).

We designed a new high-contrast sans, paying tribute to this somewhat forgotten genre.
