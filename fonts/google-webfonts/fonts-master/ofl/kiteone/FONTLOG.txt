FONTLOG for the Kite One fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Kite One Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Kite One fonts

Basic Font Information

Kite One is a rounded, monoline, humanist sans serif typeface. With an
inclination of 7 degrees, it gives a fluid reading experience. Long ascenders
and descenders, soft shapes, open counterforms and soft terminals, make Kite
One a typeface that is very suitable for long texts, especially those
associated with the natural world or childrenâ€™s tales.
