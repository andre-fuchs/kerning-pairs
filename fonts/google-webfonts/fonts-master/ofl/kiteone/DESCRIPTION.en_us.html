<p>Kite One is a rounded, monoline, humanist sans serif typeface. With an
inclination of 7 degrees, it gives a fluid reading experience. Long ascenders
and descenders, soft shapes, open counterforms and soft terminals, make Kite
One a typeface that is very suitable for long texts, especially those
associated with the natural world or childrenâ€™s tales.</p>
