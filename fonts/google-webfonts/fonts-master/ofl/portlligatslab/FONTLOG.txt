FONTLOG for the Port Lligat fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Port Lligat Slab 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Port Lligat Slab fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Port Lligat Slab is a display typeface. 
It has a soft variation in strokes, condensed 
structure, vertical stress, and a well balance 
groovy rhythm. It is particularly useful for 
both short text and headlines, but it is also 
comfortable for reading on screen. It is designed 
to become a super family with styles in many 
different typographical categories matching the 
exactly weight and width across the whole family. 
As a result they can be used together in many 
different ways.  The first releases are the 
regular Roman styles of the Sans and Slab 
families. The Slab matches exactly with the 
Sans but it has heavy slab serifs and 
rounded terminals. In small sizes looks like
a groovy serif typeface.
