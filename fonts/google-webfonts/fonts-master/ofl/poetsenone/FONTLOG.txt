FONTLOG for the Poetsen font

This file provides detailed information on the Poetsen Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Poetsen font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Inspired by the hand painted signs in supermarkets, and the roman structures
of the classical alphabets. Poetsen is a display font, but it's not just
intended to be used on big 'straight to the eye' titles. Since it has a large
x height, it can be used on short paragraphs in relatively small bodies of
text too.
