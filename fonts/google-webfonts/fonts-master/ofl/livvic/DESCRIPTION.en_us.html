<p>Livvic is a custom corporate typeface designed by Jacques Le Bailly for LV=, an insurance company based in the UK. The typeface is part of a brand redesign.</p> 

<p>Livvic was designed to capture LV=â€™s brand values and uniqueness. It is an open, friendly and somewhat quirky design. Corporate, yet still fresh and personal.</p>

<p>The Roman is an upright Italic, with some inspirations from handwriting. This gives livvic a strong, yet accessible character.</p> 

<p>The Italic has matching metrics to the Roman. Although the Italic and Roman share a lot of similarities, the construction is different. It is gives the Italic some more panache.</p>
