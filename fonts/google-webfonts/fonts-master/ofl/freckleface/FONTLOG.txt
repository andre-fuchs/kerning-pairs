FONTLOG for the Freckle Face font

This file provides detailed information on the Freckle Face font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Freckle Face
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Freckle Face draws its inspiration from Pillbury's Funny Face drink mix
packages. I loved these drink mixes when I was a kid, not only because of 
the great flavors, but also the fun packaging. Who knew I'd renew the
love affair later by finding myself loving the lettering too!

This font literally throws its weight around for a wild offbeat look.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Freckle Face is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
