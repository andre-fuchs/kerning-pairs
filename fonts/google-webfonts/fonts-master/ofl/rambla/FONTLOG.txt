Software.

Basic Font Information

Rambla is a humanist sans for medium-long texts. It’s slightly condensed, with
a generous x-height and short ascenders and descenders. Its proportions are
economical in both height and width. It’s elegant at large sizes and legible
at the same time, with a lot of rhythm in small sizes.

Rambla is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

There is two source files:

1. Rambla-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and 
   optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

2. Rambla-Regular-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file

Source files are available from
