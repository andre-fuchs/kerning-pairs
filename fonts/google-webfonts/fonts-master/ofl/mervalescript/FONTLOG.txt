Basic Font Information

Mervale Script finds its inspiration from the 1940's Fawcett Publications
Mary Marvel comic. This unusual brush lettered script blends script and 
serif capitals and a mix of unusual brush strokes to create a lively
font that draws attention.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky and Jim Lyles for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Mervale Script is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
