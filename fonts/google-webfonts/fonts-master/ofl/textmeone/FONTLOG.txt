Software.

Basic Font Information

Text Me One is a monolinear font that plays with the shapes of open counters
and un-connecting lines. A relatively large x-height and prominent in-strokes
and out-strokes aid legibility. Its flavour is playful, with a hint of pop,
and is ideal for large format lettering or continuous body text.

Text Me One is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

There are three source files:

1. TextMeOne-Regular.vfb Drawing contours

2. TextMeOne-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and 
   optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

3. TextMeOne-Regular-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
