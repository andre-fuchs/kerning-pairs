<p>Text Me One is a monolinear font that plays with the shapes of open
counters and un-connecting lines. A relatively large x-height and prominent
in-strokes and out-strokes aid legibility. Its flavour is playful, with a hint
of pop, and is ideal for large format lettering or continuous body text.</p>
