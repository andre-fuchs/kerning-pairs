FONTLOG for the Pompiere font

This file provides detailed information on Pompiere Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Pompiere 
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Pompiere is a low contrast condensed sans serif font. However 
unlike most sans it has very tall ascenders and and very small 
x height. Pompiere is playful and even a little sweet. This 
font was inspired by a handmade sign seen outside of NYC 
firefighters Squad Co. 18 in the West Village of Manhattan. 
Because of its small x height and modest weight it will work 
best at medium to large sizes.

Pompiere is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
