FONTLOG for Cutive fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Cutive 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Cutive fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The design of Cutive is based on a number of classic 
typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of IBM's 
'Executive,' and the older 'Smith-Premier.'  In Cutive 
these old faces re-emerge as a webfont that is useful 
for adding character to body texts as well as in 
larger sizes for headlines and other display uses.

Cutive is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
