Basic Font Information

Gilda Display is a font of classic proportions, in which we can see the
finest treatment of curves, strokes and serifs. The high stroke contrast has
especially smooth transitions, making this type perfect for the world of
fashion, jewelry and luxury items. Gilda Display typically contributes all its
glamor to headlines, but the considered design of this font gives it potential
for use in longer texts with a fine page texture.

Gilda Display is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

Gilda Display has an Basic Latin character set.
