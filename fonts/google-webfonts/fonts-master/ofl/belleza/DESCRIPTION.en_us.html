<p>Belleza is a humanist sans serif typeface inspired by the world of fashion. With classic proportions, high contrast in its strokes and special counters, it provides a fresh look that reminds readers of elegant models and feminine beauty.</p> <p>Belleza is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.
