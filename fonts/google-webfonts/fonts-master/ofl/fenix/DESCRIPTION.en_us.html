<p>Fenix is a serif typeface designed for use in both display and long text.
Very inspired by calligraphy, it has strong serifs and rough strokes. Its
proportions are designed to gain space savings in text, both in height and
width. It is elegant at large sizes and legible at the same time, with a lot
of rhythm in small sizes.</p>
