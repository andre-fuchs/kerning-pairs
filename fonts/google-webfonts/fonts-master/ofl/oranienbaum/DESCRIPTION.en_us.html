<p>Oranienbaum is a modern high contrast Antiqua with well-defined, recognizable features. Based on the architecture of classic Antiqua fonts, such as Bodoni, Oranienbaum is typical of the typefaces from the first quarter of the 20th century: pronounced serifs, contrasting geometry, and an interplay of right angles and flowing lines. The font is well suited for both headlines and body text.</p>
<p>It was designed through a collaboration of Oleg Pospelov as the main type designer, with Jovanny Lemonad as art director, technical engineer and publisher.</p>
