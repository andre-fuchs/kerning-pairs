<p>Once Allan was a sign painter in Berlin. Grey paneling work in the subway,
bad materials, a city split in two. Now things have changed. His (character)
palette of activities have expanded tremendously: he happily spends time
traveling, experimenting in the gastronomic field, all kinds of festivities
are no longer foreign to him. He comes with alternate features, and hints. A
typeface suited for bigger sizes and display use. Truly a type that you like
to see!</p>
