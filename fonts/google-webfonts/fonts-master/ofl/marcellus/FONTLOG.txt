FONTLOG for the Marcellus fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Marcellus
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Marcellus fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Marcellus and Marcellus SC (small caps) are a set of flared 
serif typeface, inspired by classic Roman inscription letterforms. 
While the SC family leans more towards the titling style of 
Trajan, the Regular version lends itself to a wider range of usage.
These elegant typefaces, when combined in use, exude clarity and beauty
for both on screen and printed materials.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Marcellus is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that 
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to 
support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. Marcellus-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. Marcellus-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. Marcellus-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
