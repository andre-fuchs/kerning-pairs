FONTLOG for the Junge font

This file provides detailed information on the Junge
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Junge fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Junge is an elegant and slim text typeface inspired by 
the calligraphy of Günther Junge. Thanks to a combination 
of features it performs equally well in most ranges.
At small sizes it builds the impression of flittering strokes. 
In large headlines its refined detailing become visible.

It is not as strictly structured as a text typeface,
and has subtle irregularities reminiscent of its calligraphic origin.
Junge is designed by Alexei Vanyashin (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/avanyashin">@avanyashin</a>)

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1

2. Junge-Regular-OTF.vfb (Merged and optimized file)
3. Junge-Regular-TTF.vfb (File with TTF countours and manual TT hints)
