Miltonian is a fun 'tattoo' font. 
There is also the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Miltonian+Tattoo">Miltonian Tattoo</a> variant with filled-in forms. 
For nice effects, the two fonts can be combined by overlaying them.
Also included are a few dingbats that can be used for decoration.
