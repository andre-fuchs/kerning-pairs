FONTLOG for the Stint Ultra Condensed font

This file provides detailed information on the Stint Ultra Condensed
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Stint Ultra
Condensed font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Stint Ultra Condensed is an ultra condensed square serif typestyle
developed based on the letterforms of the Syncopate Family. While
Syncopate boasts extra wide unicase forms, Stint Ultra Condensed
goes in the exact opposite direction, featuring narrow letterforms
of both Capital and lowercase variety.

Highly legible even in this ultra condensed form, Stint Ultra
Condensed is a perfect font for getting in as much information as 
possible into limited realty websites and designs.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Stint Ultra Condensed is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
