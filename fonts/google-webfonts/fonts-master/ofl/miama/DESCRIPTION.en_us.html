<p><em>Miama</em> is based on the many handwritten letters of my girlfriend.
Among them are also some ligatures and ornamental glyphs.</p><p>Every single
glyph has been drawn by myself using the free font editor FontForge.</p>
<p>Do not use any condensed nor extended spacing! <em>Miama</em> lives from
connected strokes, which are killed as soon as you change spacing.</p>
<p>Use <em>Miama</em> for main titles, short poems, greeting cards, wedding
stuff et cetera. But please do not consider using it for longer texts,
especially not for scientific texts.</p><p><em>Miama</em> is a very small
typeface compared to other fonts. This is due to the very large ascenders and
descenders. So if you want to look <em>Miama</em> as a font of 10pt, choose
15-20pt. Also keep in mind, that <em>Miama</em> then still looks quite light,
so you want probably resize it even more for titles.</p>
