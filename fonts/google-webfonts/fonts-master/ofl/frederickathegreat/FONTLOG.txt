Basic Font Information

Fredericka recalls my college days of nights spent 
creating handdrawn presentation boards, architectural 
sketches and student union posters.  She's fun, she's 
casual, she's preppy, she's classic, she's Great!

Designed by Crystal Kluge of Tart Workshop (a DBA of Font Diner, Inc)

Fredericka the Great is a Unicode typeface family that supports
