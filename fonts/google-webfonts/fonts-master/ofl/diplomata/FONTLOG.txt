FONTLOG for the Diplomata fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Diplomata Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Unlock fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Diplomata started several years ago when a friend in the printing
industry who had an old metal typeface wanted it to be digitalized for
offset printing. He brought everything the original type offered as a
start, a set of upper case characters, numbers, and some punctuation
marks.

But what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs,
and letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job
to reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and
also have in mind the changes needed for the new technological context
where Diplomata will be used.

Its style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal
expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif
and stem softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the
main stroke of each glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives
prominence to Diplomata. It is a distinct typeface, ideal for
composing headlines and small prestigious pieces of text.

To improve and expand the use of Diplomata, it was necessary to create
small caps and a lower case, which ended up constituting this family
that has two variables today.
