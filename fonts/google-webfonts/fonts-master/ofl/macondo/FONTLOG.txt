FONTLOG for the Macondo font

This file provides detailed information on the Macondo font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Macondo
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Macondo. The first purpose of this typeface was to provide an 
original and systematized style of calligraphy adapted into a 
modern digital font. The forms are inspired by some illustrations 
created for a tarot card game, itself inspired by the work of 
Colombian literature Nobel prize winning author, Gabriel 
García Márquez, «Cien Años de Soledad». Early versions of 
this font were made in 1997, but recently in 2009 it was 
substantially improved. Macondo includes several cap swashes 
and other stylish alternates, and a sister family Macondo 
Swash Caps is also available.

Designed by John Vargas Beltrán.

Macondo is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to 
support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
