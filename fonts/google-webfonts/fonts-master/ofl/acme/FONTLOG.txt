FONTLOG for Acme fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Acme 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Acme fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Acme is a condensed display typeface inspired by the 
visual language of classic cartoons and comics. It is 
designed to be used in headlines, and has a particular 
and groovy rhythm. The resulting texts are vivid but 
consistent, and its expressive characteristics work as 
well on screenÂ as in print. The glyphs were each 
carefully designed, with top curve quality. It is 
well balanced, and carefully spaced by eye.

Acme is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, Baltic
