FONTLOG for the Strong font

This file provides detailed information on the Strong 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Strong fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Strong is a clean contemporary geometrical sans with humanist 
proportions. It is designed mainly for headlines, navigation 
and short blocks of text over 14 px.

Its features like splayed terminals and contour inflections 
improve the overall dymamics of letterforms,
which is especially appreciated in Cyrillic script.

Designed by Roman Shchyukin from Gaslight.

Strong is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic script and its 
variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1, Cyrillic (ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic)
