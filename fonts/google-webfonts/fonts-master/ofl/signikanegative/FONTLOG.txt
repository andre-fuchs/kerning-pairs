FONTLOG for the Signika Negative fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Signika 
Negative Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Signika Negative fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Signika is a sans-serif with a gentle
character, developed for wayfinding, signage, and
other media where clarity of information is
required. It has a low contrast and tall x-height
to improve readability of texts in small sizes
as well as in large distances from the reader.

The typeface comes with a wide character set
supporting Western European languages, Polish,
and Czech. The figures are designed as tabular.

This is the alternative Negative version 
optimised to solve the effect of
juxtaposed positive and negative text
setting, where the text in negative tends
to look thicker.

Small caps and small-cap figures will be 
published soon.

Signika is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports 
the following Unicode ranges: Latin-1
