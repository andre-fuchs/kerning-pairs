<p>Spinnaker is based on French and UK lettering found on posters for travel by ship. Spinnaker is a low contrast and slightly wide Sans Serif design. It has a whimsy youthful sense of play to offer, in addition to the expected utility that a sans design commonly offers. Spinnaker is suitable for use in medium to large sizes.</p> <p>Updated in January 2012.</p>
