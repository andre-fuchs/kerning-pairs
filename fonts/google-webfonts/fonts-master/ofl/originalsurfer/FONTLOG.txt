FONTLOG for the Original Surfer font

This file provides detailed information on the Original Surfer font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Original Surfer
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Original Surfer is an offbeat sans serif font with loads of personality.
Inspired by a vintage advertisement for the "California Cliffs Caravan
Park", this font exudes all of the fun of a summer vacation anytime of
the year. The letterforms are clear and cleanly legible, while nothing
is formal or uptight about this font.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Original Surfer is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to 
support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
