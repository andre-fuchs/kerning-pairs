FONTLOG for Gafata fonts

Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the

Basic Font Information

Gafata is a font designed for small sizes in medium-long text, mixing elegance
and readability which is why it has great applicability in books, magazines
and web pages. In the process of finding the finest legibility, particular
features emerged making this whimsical sans serif different from the rest,
creating an original mark to the text its applied to.

Gafata is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
