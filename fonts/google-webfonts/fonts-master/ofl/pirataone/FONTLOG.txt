FONTLOG for the Pirata One font

This file provides detailed information on the Pirata One font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Pirata One and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Pirata One is a gothic textura font, simplified and optimized to work
well on screen and pixel displays. Its condensed structure and 
spacing give it an excellent performance and rhythm on texts so it
can be used as a header font or in shorts paragraphs.  

Designed by Rodrigo Fuenzalida and Nicolas Massi.

Pirata One is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There is two source files:

1. PirataOne-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and 
   optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

2. PirataOne-Regular-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
