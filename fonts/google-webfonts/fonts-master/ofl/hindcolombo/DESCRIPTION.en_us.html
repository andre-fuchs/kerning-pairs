Hind Colombo is a family of five Sinhala fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. 
In addition to Sinhala, the Hind Colombo fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind Colombo’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes.
Most strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind Colombo’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.

Hind Colombo is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Hind Colombo is named after Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka.

The Hind Colombo project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.
