<p>Recent standards and libre software allow anyone to create a font from their
own handwriting. That's what I did with Pecita. The software in question was
Ubuntu, xsane, Gimp, Inkscape and especially the wonder of wonders, FontForge.
To all the creators, thank you!</p><p>The raw material of Pecita is a scan of
my writing with its flaws and charms. The font is available as OpenType (.OTF)
from <a href="http://pecita.eu">pecita.eu</a>. It is coded with full Unicode
glyphs customary in Latin and pan European languages, the phonetic alphabet,
katakana, and many symbols. It includes many ligatures.</p><p>Version 2.5
represents the achievement of key objectives: all the Latin characters used
nowadays, katakana, all Unicode characters up to 0 Ã— 02AF, ligatures enough for
a realistic handwritten record.</p>
