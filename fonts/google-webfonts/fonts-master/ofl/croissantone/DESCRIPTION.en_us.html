<p>Croissant is a typeface inspired by the Parisian spirit, in the people and
the landscapes there. The lowercase letters have smooth round shapes, and a
nice long out-stroke to connect nearly every glyph, reminding the reader of
elegant French handwriting. The uppercases have a classical structure and soft
terminals that embody the spirit of this multi-purpose typeface.</p>
