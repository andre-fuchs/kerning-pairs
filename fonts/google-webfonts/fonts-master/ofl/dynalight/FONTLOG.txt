Basic Font Information

Dynalight is a dynamic high speed script inspired by a vintage luggage
tag for the Southern Pacific 4449 Daylight steam locomotive. Loaded
with curves and soft angles, this connecting script is an attention
getter.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Dynalight is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to
support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
