Basic Font Information

Certain calligraphic pen styles have always had a mysterious and
almost dark vibe to them from my viewpoint. Jim Nightshade is one
of those styles. 

Named after a character from the story, "Something Wicked This Way 
Comes", Jim Nightshade is a flat nib calligraphic typestyle with 
charisma and a dark flair. Letterforms follow that of a traditional
italic hand but with more angular strokes to accentuate the look.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Jim Nightshade is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded
to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
