<p>The idea of geometric typefaces with a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior design of the 1950s originated in Eurostile family by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti (1952).</p> <p>Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor Kharyk with a cold brutal character designed with the intention to perform well on screen starting from low resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical and diagonal cuts have a 45Â° angle, outlines are rounded.</p> <p>Features like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression.</p> <p>Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.</p> <p>Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions Iceland webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes.</p>
