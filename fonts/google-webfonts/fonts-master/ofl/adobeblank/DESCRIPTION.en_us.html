Adobe Blank is a special-purpose OpenType font that is based on the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS. 
(ROS stands for /Registry, /Ordering, and /Supplement, and refers to the /CIDSystemInfo dictionary entries that define the glyph set name for CID-based character collections.) 
The Adobe-Identity-0 ROS is a special-purpose character collection whose use is not tied to a specific language, and Adobe Blank 2 is a special-purpose OpenType font that is intended to render all Unicode code points using non-spacing and non-marking glyphs, thus the reason why the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS was chosen as the basis for this OpenType font.
</p>
<p>
Adobe Blank maps 1,111,998 Unicode code points to 2,048 non-spacing and non-marking glyphs (CIDs 1 through 2048). 
The 2,048 High and Low Surrogates (U+D800 through U+DFFF), the two noncharacters in the BMP and in each of the 16 Supplementary Planes (FFFE and FFFF), and the 32 noncharacters in the range U+FDD0 through U+FDEF are explicitly and intentionally excluded. 
As a fully-functional OpenType font, the following 10 'sfnt' tables are included in an OTF format version of the font: CFF, DSIG, OS/2, cmap, head, hhea, hmtx, maxp, name, and post.

<p>
In addition to a functional OpenType/CFF font, Adobe provides a TrueType (TTF) version that is available here (with a slight modification to the PostScript Name in the 'name' table from 'AdobeBlank' to 'AdobeBlank-Regular'.)

The Adobe Blank project is led by Dr. Ken Lunde, a font engineer in the Adobe Type team based in San Jose, California.
