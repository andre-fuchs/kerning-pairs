FONTLOG for the Kaushan Script fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Kaushan Script 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Kaushan fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

When making digital typefaces, the more you refine the shapes of 
the letters, the more energy you take away from them. Because of 
that, Kaushan Script is unrefined - and carries a lot of energy. 

By avoiding typographical perfection, it stays more natural. 
The angles of the vertical strokes vary a little, and the 
positioning along the baseline jumps around, giving it a more 
rustic and natural feeling.

Most script fonts have long ascenders and descenders, and this 
means they look too small when used at normal sizes on the web. 
This font is optimized in the technical details to be very 
readable as a web font, even when used as small as 16 pixels.

It was funded by people like you, via Kickstarter.

The name "Kaushan" was suggested by Vyacheslav Kaushan, 
one of the project backers.

Special thanks to the project backers! They are all listed on
