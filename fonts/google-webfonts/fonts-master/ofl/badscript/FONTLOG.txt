FONTLOG for the Bad Script font

This file provides detailed information on the Bad Script 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Bad Script fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Bad Script started from a simple six-letter logotype
and developed into a separate font, supporting Latin and Cyrillic 
character sets. It was completely made using a tablet to 
imitate casual and neat handwriting. Designed by Roman Shchyukin, 
in a way it resembles the designer's own handwriting, while 
making it systematic and smooth.

Bad Script is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic script and its variants, 
and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1, Cyrillic (ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic)
