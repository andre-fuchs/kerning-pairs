FONTLOG for the Oregano fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Oregano Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Oregano fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Oregano family is based on cartoon style lettering of calligrapher
and logo designer Rand Holub. This style of hand lettering adorned many 
retro brochures and advertisements of the late 40's through the 1960's.

This approachable vintage spunk-filled lettering style exudes a casual
and care free flavor perfect for both on screen and printed materials.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Oregano is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that 
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to 
support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
