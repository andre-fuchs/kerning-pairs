Software.

font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Henny Penny is an offbeat display font with loads of 
personality, named in honour of the fairy-tale character 
chicken Henny Penny. It is a friendly and playful 
decorative typeface. Its classical nature is successfully 
hidden behind its very informal structure: There is no 
common baseline, no common character size and no common 
slope of the letters. This makes the typeface very 
amusing. Henny Penny is a headline typeface for using 
in display typography. It may be used for children's 
books, magazines and websites.

Designed by Olga Umpeleva for Brownfox

Henny Penny is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script.
