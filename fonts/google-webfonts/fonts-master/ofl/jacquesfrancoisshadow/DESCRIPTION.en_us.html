<p>Jacques Francois Shadow is an incised variant of the <a
href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Jacques+Francois">Jacques
Francois</a> font.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois revives the c. 1760 Enschedé no. 811 type specimen by Jacques
François Rosart (1714-1774), made for Enschedé Printing House. The concept was
to create a contemporary webfont with an even typographic color while
preserving the essential historic peculiarities and expanding the character
set. Compared to the historic specimen the x-height is generously increased
and contrast lowered.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois Shadow is designed for large sizes and manually instructed
for better screen performance starting from 24 ppem. This means that on Window
machines it will work best from 18pt (at 96ppi) or 15pt (at 120ppi) and from
24pt on Mac (at 72ppi.)</p>
