FONTLOG for the Germania One font

This file provides detailed information on the Germania One
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Germania One font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Germania One is a hybrid between two historical and functional 
concepts found in German typography, the old fraktur and the 
simplified geometric sans serif forms from the Bauhaus. I 
sought to create a new font that mixes these two styles to 
provide a new and original typeface. Something modern and 
at the same time old, reworking the geometric forms in a 
contemporary and expressive way.

Designed by John Vargas Beltr치n

Germania One is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to 
support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
