History

This is another of my old fonts used to inscriptions on stone.
I created the ModernAntiqua font about 14-15 years ago (like other fonts - when
I started doing the inscriptions on stone professionally).
The font is based on Roman square capitals. 
Initially the font contained only capitals and digits. Later I made missing
small fonts and some basical signs.
Last year I started convert my fonts to the TTF files. The first was NovaCut
and all the Nova family, next MedievalSharp, and here's another...

I have modified the font to follow the Google Web Fonts vertical
metrics guidelines, and added 'magic' hinting settings. You can read
more about this here:
