<p>This is a favorite of mine.  A talented photography student I know was writing something down and I squealed and ran over to beg her for a sample of her writing.  It was worth the effort, as I adore her style and feel it translated perfectly into a cute font. She named the font as a nod to one of her favorite bands, Jackâ€™s Mannequin.</p>
