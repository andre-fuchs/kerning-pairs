Basic Font Information

Metamorphous is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use 
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: 
Latin-1, Latin-2: Easern Europe, Turkish, Macintosh Character Set
