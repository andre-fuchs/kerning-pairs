<p>Myanmar Sans Pro is an initial style for a type family that harmonizes with Adobe's Source Sans Pro family. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces, and also in long form documents in headings and in body text.</p>
<p>Please note that the font is Unicode encoded, so requires Unicode encoded text to work correctly. Also, it will only work on platforms with Myanmar OpenType support - those that use harfbuzz, and Window 8 - which does not include earlier Windows and Apple systems.</p>
