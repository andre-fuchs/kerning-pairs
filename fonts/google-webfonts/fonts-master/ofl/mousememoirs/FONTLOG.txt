Basic Font Information

Mouse Memoirs finds its inspiration in the vintage Mickey Mouse,
Beagle Boys, and Uncle Scrooge comic books put out by Walt Disney in
the 1950's and 60's. This font comes alive with a truly animated look.
Perfect for light-hearted designs, children's books, and the likeâ€¦
it is an all-around fun typeface.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Mouse Memoirs is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
