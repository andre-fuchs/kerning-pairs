FONTLOG for the Miniver font

This file provides detailed information on the 
Miniver font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Miniver fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Miniver was inspired by a trip made to the library, 
looking for new ideas. Immediately gravitating towards 
the DVD for the 1942 film Mrs. Miniver, the hand-lettered 
title on the cover had a very contemporary look and 
feel so, there was the 'springboard' into a new font. 
First drawn were the inline forms and then they were 
traced, utilizing a playful 'cutout' effect.

Designed by Dathan Boardman of Open Window
