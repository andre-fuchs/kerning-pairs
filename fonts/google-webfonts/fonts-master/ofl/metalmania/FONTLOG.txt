FONTLOG for the Metal Mania font

This file provides detailed information on the 
Metal Mania font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Metal Mania fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Metal Mania was inspired by lots of Heavy Metal album covers 
and posters. Only the most 'Metal' elements were combined to 
make the quintessential Heavy Metal font. Looks good on 
concert posters and guitar picks! Long live Metal Mania.

First drawn were the inline forms and then they were traced, utilizing a playful 'cutout' effect.
