Basic Font Information

Stalemate is a script of vintage origins but still modern flair. This
script exudes confidence and carefree attitude and makes a bold
statement in any design.

Designed by Jim Lyles for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Stalemate is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
