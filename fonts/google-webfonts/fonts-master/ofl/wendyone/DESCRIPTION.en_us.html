<p>Wendy is loosely inspired by the STABILO logotype, a brand that works as a
conceptual and aesthetic reference. It evokes in me design values, form and
style.</p>

<p>The challenge was take a logotype consisting of seven letters as a starting
point to develop an alphabet. I liked the idea of the original logo for the
beauty of its forms: original and risky. I liked to continue the work of
someone whose development was arrested at another time, to animate these
characters, giving them new life through the design of a typeface that finds
the balance between the old and new forms. </p>

<p>The font was developed by Alejandro Inler in conjunction with Julieta
Ulanovsky.</p>
