This file provides detailed information on the Rufina font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Rufina and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Rufina combines features of several typographic styles with Bodoni forms found
in the calligraphy of flexible tip pens. High contrast enables it to work
well in text and headlines.

Rufina is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

There is two source files:

1. Rufina-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and 
   optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

2. Rufina-Regular-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file

Source files are available from
