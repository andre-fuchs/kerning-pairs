<p>Waiting for the Sunrise is based on the handwriting of a high school student. The title comes from the song <a href="http://theafters.com/music/">Lift Me Up by The Afters</a>. Although this font was created during a time of darkness in my life, it is a cheery, perky font. It is a reminder to me of the joy that comes after mourning.</p>
