Basic Font Information

Sevillana is named after a folk music style widespread 
in Seville (Andalusia) in Spain. The typeface is inspired 
by the lettering of commemorative plates which can be 
seen on house walls in Andalusia. 

Those ceramic plates are handmade and each one is 
unique. Individual handwriting may vary but the 
style is always recognizable. 

Sevillana is a generalized character based on that 
diversity, a headline typeface that can be used in 
middle and large sizes, it can be used for restaurant 
menus, concert posters, different kinds of signage etc.

Designed by Olga Umpeleva for Brownfox.

Sevillana is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script.
