FONTLOG for the McLaren font

This file provides detailed information on the McLaren Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the McLaren fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The McLaren typeface was created to act as a generic go-to comic style
lettering. It has simple clean letterforms with a mild bounce and 
offbeat quality to it without going too far.

It is cleanly legible for small bursts of copy to larger bodies of text,
perfect for books for children, comics, and anything requiring a mildly
playful yet clearly readable font.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

McLaren is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. McLaren-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. McLaren-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. McLaren-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
