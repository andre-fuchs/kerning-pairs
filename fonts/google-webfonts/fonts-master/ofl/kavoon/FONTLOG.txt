Basic Font Information

Kavoon is a display face based on experiments with brush and ink. 
Kavoon's expressive features make words vivid and powerfully draw 
the reader in. Kavoon may be used from medium to large sizes.

Kavoon is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use 
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release partially supports the following Unicode 
ranges: Latin-1

There are two Source files:

   for version 1.003 and earlier
