FONTLOG for the Peralta font

This file provides detailed information on the Peralta Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Peralta font
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Peralta typeface is an egyptian slab serif gone haywire. You'll
find that Capitals and Lowercase have opposite weight distributions, as
well as an all-around offbeat nature, and yet it all works to create a 
delightfully comic typeface.

Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI).

Peralta is a Unicode typeface that supports languages that use the 
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other
scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic

There are 3 source files:

1. Peralta-Regular.vfb Original Source files with contour overlaps

2. Peralta-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and optimized file 
   corresponding to the OTF file

3. Peralta-Regular-TTF.vfb TrueType outlines with hinting 
   adjustments corresponding to the TTF file
