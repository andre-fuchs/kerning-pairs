FONTLOG for the Julee fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Julee Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Julee fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The peculiarity of this typography lies in its curved 
structures and strokes, which are developed on it by 
getting thinner and sharper as if they were being typed 
using a metallic and bevel-edged point.

The visual mark characteristic of Julee is a casual 
cursive-like type, yet balanced due to the tidy 
proportions of its signs.
