Font Software.

the Inder font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Inder is a low contrast workhorse sans serif text 
face design. It was inspired by german art noveau 
style lettering and the Amsterdam School of 
architecture. Inder has been carefully adjusted 
to the restrictions of the screen. Inder can be 
used in a wide range of sizes.

Inder is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants,
and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2: Easern Europe, 
Turkish, Macintosh Character Set
