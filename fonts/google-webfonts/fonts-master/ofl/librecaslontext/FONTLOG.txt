FONTLOG for the Libre Caslon fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Libre Caslon Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Libre Caslon fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Libre Caslon Text is optimized for web body text (typically set at 16px).
Libre Caslon Display is optimized for Headlines.

There are already lots of digital Caslon's revivals, and lots of Caslon-esque fonts. Some are very good. But none of them was truly made for the web. While they look very good when printed on paper, they render very small when used for web body text on the screen.

Libre Caslon Text, instead, was specifically tailored to be used for web body text (typically set at 16px). It can be used at very small sizes and will still be readable on your website.

Another big difference is that pretty much all other digital Caslons revivals are based on 18th Century specimens by William Caslon I and Wiliam Caslon II. Libre Caslon, instead, it's based on hand lettering artists Caslon's interpretations typical of 1950 advertising. 

Libre Caslon Text also include some nice, extra Open Type features:
- 17 ligatures on the regular styles, and XX ligatures on the italic styles
- Lining Proportional Numbers (Default style).
- Lining Tabular Numbers and punctuation.
- Old Style Prortional Numbers.
- Inferiors, Superiors, Numerators, Denominators.
- Fractions.
- Ordinals.
