<p>Volkhov is a low-contrast seriffed typeface with a robust character, intended for providing a motivating reading experience.</p> <p>As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex text environments being economic and legible, contemporary and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this purpose: large open counters, rather short descenders, and brutal asymmetric serifs.</p> <p>Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart to the rigorous Regular.</p> <p>Designed by Ivan Petrov.</p>
