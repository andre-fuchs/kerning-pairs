FONTLOG for the Volkhov font

This file provides detailed information on the Volkhov 
font Software.

Basic Font Information

Volkhov is a low-contrast serifed typeface with a robust 
character,  intended for conveying a motivating reading 
experience.

As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex 
text environments being economic and legible, contemporary 
and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this 
purpose:  large open counters, rather short descenders, and 
brutal asymmetric serifs.

Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to
the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown 
inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive 
calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart 
to the rigorous Regular.

Volkhov is designed by Ivan Petrov.

Volkhov is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1
