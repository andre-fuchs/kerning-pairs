Judson font
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Judson font.
This information should be distributed along with the Judson font and any
derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Judson is a serif font designed for African literacy. It contains as many glyphs
and precomposed combinations that I know of for all African languages written in
Latin-derived alphabets.  It uses OpenType tables for correct placement of
diacritical marks, including stacked marks.  Care has been taken so that all
characters are easily distinguished, even in the italic face.  The medium roman
face also contains support for the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

Currently Judson is only available in roman, italic and bold faces; at this
time there is no bold italic.

Judson is not suitable for setting Icelandic or Old/Middle English texts,
because the uppercase Eth (U+00D0) takes a unique African form.
