Basic Font Information

What's on your font menu tonight? The same old boring 
beans? Then why not try Frijole! It's a fresh new 
face that's anything but re-fried. And it's sure to 
be a hit when you're cooking up something that needs 
to be bold, spicy and satisfying! Another fresh font 
from Squid and Sideshow.

Designed by Dave 'Squid' Cohen of Sideshow (a DBA 
of Font Diner, Inc)
