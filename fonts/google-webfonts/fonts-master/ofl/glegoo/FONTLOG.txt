FONTLOG for the Glegoo fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Glegoo Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Glegoo fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Glegoo, a truly modern slab serif. This Regular style is the first of
what will be a large typeface family. It has a precise balance of
shapes, counterforms and strokes. Glegoo is slightly condensed, has a
large x-height, short ascenders/descenders and large counterforms.
These attributes all add up to help reading text, even in very small
sizes. Its careful design and proper choice of weight generate a nice
texture in paragraphs of text, but the design is also intended to work
well when composing headlines with presence and elegance. Large usage
will show off the delicate modulation of strokes that are in this
font.

Devanagari was added in August 2014.
