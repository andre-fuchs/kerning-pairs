FONTLOG for the Euphoria Script font

This file provides detailed information on the Euphoria Script 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Euphoria Script font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
 
Euphoria Script is an informal 
script type. It began with letterform sketches 
made by hand with a copperplate nib, which were 
redrawn digitally with the stroke endings of a 
brush script. This makes the type seem playful, 
which is important in casual scripts.

It has very fast curves, thanks to the slight 
slant angle, but it remains highly legible. It will 
be perfect for titles and short phrases in branding, 
magazines, content about food, fashion, music - 
anything which is as lively as the font itself.
