FONTLOG for the Enriqueta font

This file provides detailed information on the Enriqueta 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Enriqueta font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Enriqueta is a serif typeface designed to meet the technical 
demands of silkscreen printing. Since that is a grid system, 
this makes it an excellent candidate for digital display 
applications too since they are built in pixels.

Itâ€™s a slab serif type with clear, direct and not so subtle 
features, that was conceived as a hybrid that takes from 
the Egyptian style some robustness and strong serifs, and 
from Roman fonts the proportions and soft humanist tones, 
resulting in a harmonic and legible typeface for texts.

Enriqueta was selected to be exhibit at Tipos Latinos 2010, 
fourth Latin-american tipography biennial and to be part 
of the German editorial project Typodarium 2012.

Designed by Viviana Monsalve & Gustavo Ibarra 
for FontFuror (www.fontfuror.com).

Enriqueta is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, 
and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin 
Extended-A, and Latin Extended-B.
