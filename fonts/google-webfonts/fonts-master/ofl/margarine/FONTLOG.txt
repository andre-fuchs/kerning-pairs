Basic Font Information

Margarine draws its roots loosely from various inspirations, with a
thick marker weight and deliberate carrying of rounds into regularly
straightened lowercase characters, this typeface has that warm and fuzzy
feeling to it.

Margarine is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use
the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
