It has ornamental vowel marks that evoke a traditional Indian feeling and is suitable for headlines, invitations, posters and other uses at large sizes. 
Dhurjati is named after the Telugu poet from the court of the king Krishnadevaraya, and was one of the Astadiggajalu (literally eight legends) there.
