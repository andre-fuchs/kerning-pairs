Basic Font Information

Hear that? That's the sound of tropical ocean breezes 
as they whistle gently through your laptop! Grab a mai-tai, 
a hammock under a swaying palm tree and let your hair down 
as your fingers gently caress the keyboard just like seaweed! 
Enjoy Seaweed Script when a rustic tropical beachside script 
is called for and watch out for Squid!
