FONTLOG for Seymour fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Seymour 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Seymour fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Seymour One is derived from the earlier webfont Sigmar One,
but the forms have also been influenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth
century British sans-serif typefaces. The result is a display face that is
ideal for bold, unpretentious, and slightly playful display typography.
Seymour One is designed to be used conventionally but also as an 'all caps'
font.

Seymour One is designed to be used freely across the internet by web
browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

Please see the document 'Supported-Languages.pdf' to see which languages are fully supported by this font. 

There are 4 Source files:


1. FONT.ufo Original Source Files in UFO format

2. FONT.sfd Original Source Files for FontForge

3. FONT.otf Original Source Files in OpenType format

4. FONT-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines that correspond to the unhinged TTF file
