<p>Karla is a grotesque sans serif typeface family that supports languages
that use the Latin script and the Tamil script. This is the Tamil script
part of the family, with Inclined styles in two weights, Regular and Bold.</p>

<p>The Latin part is available from the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Karla">Karla specimen</a> page.</p>

<p>Karla Tamil does not currently work on iPhones and iPads, because iOS
doesn't render OpenType Layout shaping, only AAT shaping. Mac OS X, Windows
and GNU+Linux all render OpenType Layout shaping. These Tamil fonts do not
have AAT shaping, so they won't render correctly, but the iOS system font
does.</p>
