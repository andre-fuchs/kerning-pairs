FONTLOG for the Devonshire font

This file provides detailed information on the Devonshire 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Devonshire fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Devonshire is a non-connecting brush script typeface of 
medium weight. Its playful brush letterforms are reminiscent 
of old sign painter scripts, while being restricted to none 
of the rules of a connecting script font, allowing it to 
visually dance.

Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky for Astigmatic (AOETI).

Devonshire is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2, Turkish, and Windows Baltic
