FONTLOG for the Keania One font

This file provides detailed information on the Keania One font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Keania One and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Keania is a re-development of Kenia. http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Kenia

As a stencil font its idea stems from experiences of travel and life in Kenya,
especially from the large lettering seen on shop fronts and market stands.

The shapes play with sharp and soft corners and create a rhythmic pattern
of black and white. This font is great for magazine headings, adverts and
sporty content.

Keania One is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.

There are three source files:

1. KeaniaOne-Regular.vfb Drawing contours

2. KeaniaOne-Regular-OTF.vfb Merged contours and 
   optimized file corresponding to the OTF file

3. KeaniaOne-Regular-TTF.sfd TrueType outlines with 
   hinting adjustments corresponding to the TTF file

Source files are available from
