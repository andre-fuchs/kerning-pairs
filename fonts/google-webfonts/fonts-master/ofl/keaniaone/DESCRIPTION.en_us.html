<p>Keania is a re-development of 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Kenia">Kenia</a>. As a 
stencil font its idea stems from experiences of travel and life in Kenya, 
especially from the large lettering seen on shop fronts and market stands.</p>

<p>The shapes play with sharp and soft corners and create a rhythmic pattern
of black and white. This font is great for magazine headings, adverts and
sporty content.</p>
