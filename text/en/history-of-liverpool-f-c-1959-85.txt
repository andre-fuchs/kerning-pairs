The history of Liverpool Football Club from 1959 to 1985 covers the period from the appointment of Bill Shankly as manager of the then Second Division club, to the Heysel Stadium disaster and its aftermath.
Overhauling the team during his first year at Liverpool, Shankly released 24 players and converted a boot storage room into a meeting place where he and his coaches discussed strategy. They won the 1961–62 Second Division title and were promoted to the First Division. Two seasons later, Liverpool won their first League title since 1946–47, thereby qualifying for Liverpool's first participation in UEFA competition. The following season, Liverpool won their first FA Cup. Further League titles followed in 1965–66 and 1972–73. 1973 brought their first European trophy, the 1972-73 UEFA Cup. The following season, Shankly's last, they won the FA Cup again.
Shankly's assistant Bob Paisley took over in 1974. His first season in charge was trophiless before winning the League title and UEFA Cup the following season. Three European Cups and four League titles followed before Paisley retired at the end of 1982–83. His assistant, Joe Fagan, took over.
Liverpool won a trophy treble during Fagan's first season as manager, winning the League title for the third straight year, the Football League Cup for the fourth straight year and a fourth European Cup. The following season, the club was involved in one of the worst football stadium disasters. Before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final versus Juventus, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. This tragedy, the Heysel Stadium disaster, caused a five-year UEFA competition expulsion of English clubs.
Bill Shankly was appointed Liverpool manager on 1 December 1959. Shankly was approached at Huddersfield Town by Liverpool chairman Tom Williams, who asked if Shankly would like to manage "the best club in the country". Shankly replied, "Why, is Matt Busby packing up?" Liverpool's potential and the lack of ambition Shankly perceived at Huddersfield led him to accept. When he joined Liverpool the club had been in the Second Division since 1953–54 relegation. In his first season Shankly debuted Ian Callaghan, the club's future record appearance holder, and Roger Hunt, the club's future record League goalscorer.The club finished third outside the promotion spots in Shankly's first part-season (1959/60). He released 24 players at the season's end. As well as Callaghan and Hunt he also retained Gerry Byrne. Shankly recognising the abilities of the existing coaching team of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett retained all three. An Anfield boot storage room was adopted as a strategy discussion venue by him and his coaches. The Boot Room, as it became known, became integral to their success. Bob Paisley remarked, "You got a more wide-ranging discussion in the Boot Room than the boardroom. What went on was kept within those four walls. There was a certain mystique about the place."
They again finished third the following 1960/61 season. Despite a 14-game run without loss, 5 defeats in the opening 11 matches  cost Liverpool promotion. Shareholder John Moores felt the club needed to spend more money on players to be successful and encouraged chairman T. V. Williams to do so. That summer of 1961 Shankly signed Ian St John from Motherwell and Ron Yeats from Dundee United. ‘Take a walk around my centre-half, gentlemen, he’s a colossus!’ Shankly said to the press conference when announcing Yeats’ arrival. Shankly confidently challenged the board of directors to "sack me if they can't play." St John and Yeats in their first season helped win promotion to the First Division; Unbeaten at home all season, they won the Second Division with 62 points.Liverpool were back in the First Division for the first time in eight years in 1962–63. Liverpool won only four and lost seven of their first 14 games back in the top flight. Shankly responded by signing Willie Stevenson at left half. They were up to fifth by March 1963 after 13 unbeaten matches. After their 1–0 FA Cup semi-final loss to Leicester City, poor results including a 7–2 loss to Tottenham Hotspur led to finishing eighth.In summer of 1963 Shankly signed Peter Thompson from Preston North End to play on the right side of midfield. In October he debuted Tommy Lawrence who dominated the club's goalkeeping for the rest of the decade. Liverpool started 1963–64 poorly, taking only nine points from the first nine games. Their 2–1 first Merseyside derby win over Everton since 1950 initiated moving up the table. They won 47 points from their next 30 games  securing their sixth League title and their first qualification for UEFA competition. Success increased Anfield's average attendance above 50,000. Increasingly vocal fans adopted You'll Never Walk Alone as their anthem.Shankly changed the team kit for their 1964-65 European Cup second round tie versus R.S.C. Anderlecht. He felt the players in the new all-red would appear more intimidating than in the previous red shirts, white shorts and white socks. Liverpool lost in the semi-final to Internazionale. Shankly felt the referee biased allowing questionable Italian goals. In the 1965 FA Cup Final Hunt put Liverpool ahead in extra time. Leeds United's Billy Bremner equalised. St John then scored for a 2–1 first ever Liverpool FA Cup triumph. Defence of their League title ended in seventh place.The 1966 European Cup Winners' Cup Final was 1–1 after 90 minutes. Borussia Dortmund won 2–1 after extra time. Shankly stated afterwards, "We didn't play well and we gave away two silly goals." Their FA Cup defence ended in the third round to Chelsea. They regained the League title on the last day of April 1966 with two Hunt goals to beat Chelsea . Yeats matched Alex Raisbeck and Donald MacKinlay as double league title winning, Scottish Liverpool captains.
Liverpool exited 7–3 on aggregate to Johan Cruyff's Ajax in the 1966–67 European Cup second round. They finished fifth in the 1966–67 Football League winning only 2 of their last 11 games.Liverpool were league leaders through much of September, October and November 1967. Playing 59 games all season, they were unable to sustain a domestic nor Inter-Cities Fairs Cup challenge. They finished third in the 1967–68 Football League behind champions Manchester City. Their furthest progress that season in three knock-out trophies was the FA Cup quarter-final.Poor performances in the 1968/69 cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season. They finished second in the 1968–69 Football League six points behind Leeds United. Left back, Gerry Byrne, retired after 333 appearances and 12 seasons. Shankly started replacing ageing players in his squad, purchasing future captain Emlyn Hughes and goalkeeper Ray Clemence the season before. Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of £96,000 from Chelsea, but transferred after a year to Coventry City after injury and poor form. Mid-season Shankly signed Alun Evans from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a then record £100,000 fee for a teenager. After a good start, Evans' career was curtailed by injuries.Liverpool were unbeaten in their first ten 1969–70 Football League matches until a 1–0 loss to Manchester United. A sixth-round FA Cup loss at second division Watford convinced Shankly to move on older players. Bobby Graham had already replaced Hunt as the main striker. St John and Yeats also made their last Liverpool appearances. Liverpool exited in the early rounds of the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and League Cup and finished fifth in the league behind champions Everton.In 1970–71 players such as Clemence, Hughes, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd and Steve Heighway reduced the average age of the team to 22. 21 year old John Toshack signed in November from Cardiff City for a club record £110,000 to spearhead the attack. His first Liverpool goal was 11 days later in a 3-2 derby comeback win after being two down to Everton. Liverpool had a second consecutive fifth place league finish. They exited the 1970-71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals to Leeds United. Brian Hall's goal clinched a 1970-71 FA Cup 2-1 comeback semi final over Everton. Heighway put Liverpool ahead in extra time in the final. Arsenal this time came back to win 2–1 for a Gunners League and cup double.Shankly signed 20 year old Kevin Keegan from Scunthorpe United on 10 May 1971. On his full debut in the 1971-72 Football League Keegan scored after 12 minutes. This was the first of 100 Keegan Liverpool goals and a successful strike partnership with Toshack. 18 year old Phil Thompson debuted as a substitute in a 3-0 Easter Monday win over Manchester United. Liverpool contesting a four-way title fight lost 1-0 in their penultimate game at Brian Clough's Derby County who had now completed their fixtures. On Monday 8 May 1972, Leeds' 2-1 loss at Wolverhampton Wanderers gave Liverpool their bite at the title. Needing to win the same evening if Leeds lost, Liverpool drew 0-0 at Arsenal with Shankly furious an 88th minute Toshack goal was disallowed. Derby stayed top.
In July 1972 Peter Cormack signed from Nottingham Forest equaling the record £110,000 fee Liverpool paid for John Toshack. Shankly described Cormack's signature as, 'The final piece in the jigsaw' of that team. In the 1972–73 season they duly won the League and the club's first European trophy, the UEFA Cup. Cormack and Keegan scored in a 2-0 Easter Monday showdown with title rivals, Don Revie's Leeds United. Fellow title contenders Arsenal only drew at Southampton the same day. Liverpool needing a final game draw for the title drew 0-0 at home versus Leicester City. Their eighth League title equalled the record held by Arsenal and was their first captained by a non-Scot, Tommy Smith. A 1973 UEFA Cup Final downpour meant the home first leg was abandoned after 27 minutes. Shankly in those 27 minutes felt the Borussia Mönchengladbach defence was suspect in the air. Shankly started tall forward, John Toshack, in the re-arranged game demoting the small build of Brian Hall to a substitute appearance in a 3-0 win. Toshack headed assists for two Keegan strikes with Lloyd also heading a goal. A 2–0 second leg, away loss meant Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate. They were the first English team to win the League and a UEFA competition in the same season.John Smith became chairman in 1973 with his business experience to build a more corporate view for the club. He ended the club's policy of changing chairmen every three years. In 1973 the old Main Stand was demolished and replaced with official opening by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. They exited to Yugoslav team Red Star Belgrade in the 1973–74 European Cup second round. Their 1973-74 Football League campaign was bookended with poor results (in contrast to champions Leeds United unbeaten in their first league 29 games). Liverpool finished second. A second FA Cup win came with two goals by Keegan and one by Heighway in the 1974 FA Cup Final beating Newcastle United 3–0. Ray Kennedy's end of season transfer from Arsenal was Shankly's last act as Liverpool manager. He resigned citing the need for a break and was replaced by his assistant Bob Paisley.
Shankly continued to turn up at their Melwood training ground where the players still referred to him as 'boss'. Reluctantly, Paisley asked him to stay away from training, in order to assert his authority as manager. Liverpool  were unbeaten in their first six 1974–75 Football League campaign matches. They recorded their record highest win, 11-0, versus Strømsgodset in the 1974–75 European Cup Winners' Cup first round. Liverpool exited to Hungarians Ferencváros on the away goals rule in the second round. They exited in the fourth round in the FA Cup and Football League Cup. They finished second in the league for a trophyless season. Paisley signed Phil Neal, Terry McDermott and Jimmy Case who would all score in future UEFA finals.Liverpool began the 1975–76 Football League campaign losing 2–0 to Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Liverpool's form picked up in the second half of the season. Only one point dropped in nine late season games left them a point behind QPR going into their final match. QPR had already finished their games. Wolverhampton Wanderers were a goal up at half-time but Liverpool won 3–1 to win the League title. Liverpool exited early in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, Club Brugge scored two early goals at Anfield before Ray Kennedy, Case and a Keegan penalty fought back for a 3-2 first leg lead. Keegan's equaliser in Belgium was enough for a 4-3 aggregate win and a second Liverpool winning of that trophy.Before the start of 1976–77 season, Keegan said, "There's a tremendous ambition among all the lads to win the European Cup. We've won everything else in the last five years and there's a feeling that the European Cup is going to be next." Liverpool started by losing only two of their first 16 games in the League to go top by September. Despite a Christmas period blip including a 5–1 loss to Aston Villa, Liverpool won their tenth League title. The 1977 European Cup Final was Liverpool's first. McDermott, Smith and Neal goals gave a 3-1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach. They lost the 1977 FA Cup Final 2-1 to Manchester United to miss out on a trophy treble.
On 10 August 1977 Kenny Dalglish signed from Celtic for a new club record £440,000 fee to replace Keegan's £500,000 departure to Hamburg. Alan Hansen signed from Partick Thistle two months before Dalglish and Graeme Souness followed in January from Middlesbrough. Dalglish scored 20 goals in 42 1977–78 Football League games and scored from a Souness pass in Liverpool's 1978 European Cup Final 1–0 win over Club Brugge. They were the first British team to retain the European Cup. They finished seven points behind Nottingham Forest in the League who also beat them 1-0 in the 1978 Football League Cup Final replay. The first game was 0-0. Liverpool declined to take part in the 1977 Intercontinental Cup.Nottingham Forest beat Liverpool 2–0 on aggregate in the 1978-79 European Cup first round. Liverpool exited 1–0 to Sheffield United in the 1978-79 Football League Cup second round. They won their first six league games and were unbeaten before a match 12, 1–0 derby loss to Everton. Good form continued through the 1978-79 Football League campaign winning eight points above Nottingham Forest. Their 68 league points surpassed the previous record, 67 by Leeds United in 1968–69. Only 16 goals conceded was another record. Liverpool declined to take part in the 1978 Intercontinental Cup.Despite early defeats to Southampton and Nottingham Forest, Liverpool topped the 1979-80 Football League by January staying top for the rest of the season. A 4–1 win over Aston Villa in the penultimate game of the season retained the League title. They were unbeaten at Anfield all season where they conceded only eight goals. Liverpool exited in the first round of the European Cup to Soviet team Dinamo Tbilisi. They exited in the semi finals of the FA Cup and League Cup to Arsenal and Forest respectively. Liverpool were the first British club with a shirt sponsor, Hitachi. Chairman John Smith said, "The days are gone when a club like ours can control its destiny on the money coming through the turnstiles." In April 1980 Liverpool signed 18 year old Welsh striker Ian Rush, the club's future record goalscorer.In the 1980–81 Football League eight losses (the same as champions, Aston Villa), and 17 draws meant finishing fifth, their worst finish for 16 years. Their 1981 Football League Cup Final replay, 2-1 come back win over West Ham United was their first lifting of that trophy. Alan Kennedy put Liverpool ahead in extra-time in the 1-1 first game draw. Hansen and Dalglish scored in the replay. Alan Kennedy's solitary goal beat Real Madrid 1-0 for a third Liverpool European Cup Final win. They lost in the fourth round of the 1980-81 FA Cup 2-1 at Everton.
Bruce Grobbelaar became first team goalkeeper after Clemence's 1981 summer transfer to Tottenham Hotspur.  In the 1981-82 Football League campaign, Liverpool were twelfth after a Boxing Day 3-1 home defeat to Manchester City with only 6 wins from 17 games. Paisley responded by taking the club captaincy from Thompson and giving it to Souness. 11 successive wins towards the end of the season won the League four points above Ipswich Town. Liverpool lost 2-0 at Second Division Chelsea in the 1981-82 FA Cup fifth round. Ronnie Whelan equalised Steve Archibald's Tottenham goal with three minutes left in the 1982 Football League Cup Final. Liverpool retained the trophy 3-1 after extra-time with Whelan's second goal and one by Ian Rush. The 1981 Intercontinental Cup was Liverpool's first in that tournament. Flamengo won 3-0 at the National Stadium in Tokyo.Liverpool retained the League title in 1982–83, 11 points above Watford. Liverpool exited the FA Cup and European Cup in the fifth round and quarter-final respectively. A 1983 Football League Cup Final, 2–1 win over Manchester United meant Liverpool won that trophy for a third straight year. Alan Kennedy's late equaliser of Norman Whiteside's goal took the final to extra-time. Whelan scored the winner. Pre-season, Paisley announced it would be his last before retiring from management aged 64. Paisley won six League titles, three European Cups and three League Cups during his managerial reign, the most successful in Liverpool's history. His assistant, Joe Fagan, took over.
Fagan's era began with a unique treble. Liverpool topped the 1982-83 Football League in November and stayed there to win three points above Southampton. This equalled the record three consecutive League titles held by Huddersfield Town and Arsenal. Ian Rush top scored with 32 league goals and 13 in other competitions. The 1984 Football League Cup Final win was their fourth in a row. Everton were beaten by a solitary Souness goal in a replay at Maine Road after a 0–0 at Wembley Stadium In the 1984 European Cup Final they faced A.S. Roma at Roma's Stadio Olimpico. Neal scored first in a game drawn 1–1 after 90 minutes and extra time. In the penalty shoot-out, Steve Nicol shot the first kick over the bar. Neal, Souness, and Rush scored theirs to put liverpool 3-2 ahead after Bruno Conti had also shot over the bar. Francesco Graziani's spot kick rebounded over the bar after Grobbelaar's 'spaghetti legs' antics on the goal line. Alan Kennedy scored the decisive kick.
Liverpool lost the 1984 Intercontinental Cup to Argentine side CA Independiente 1–0 in Tokyo.In 1984-85 Liverpool failed to win a trophy for the first time in nine years. In October in the 1984-85 Football League Liverpool were in the relegation places. Form improved to finish second 13 points behind Everton. They exited in the third round of the 1984-85 Football League Cup. Semi final loss to Manchester United prevented an all Merseyside 1985 FA Cup Final with Everton.The 1985 European Cup Final was Liverpool's fifth such final. Before the match at the Heysel Stadium began, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating opposing fans. As Juventus fans fled to safety, the accumulation of people against a perimeter wall caused it to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. The wall collapse was followed by Juventus fans rioting at the stadium's other end. The match was delayed two hours before starting with fear abandonment would cause further violence. Michel Platini's penalty won the final 1–0 for the Italians.In the tragedy's aftermath, blame for the Heysel Stadium disaster was laid on the Liverpool fans. UEFA official Günter Schneider stated, "Only the English fans were responsible. Of that, there is no doubt." The Football Association withdrew English clubs from European competition. Two days later UEFA banned English clubs for "an indeterminate period of time". Liverpool were banned for three further years beyond the English club ban ending. Fagan had decided to retire before the match. With his 64th birthday approaching he felt not the ideal choice for the required team rebuilding. Dalglish took over, the club's first player-manager.
